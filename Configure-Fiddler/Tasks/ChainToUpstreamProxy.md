To configure Fiddler to send and receive web traffic to and from another proxy between Fiddler and the destination server:

1. Close Fiddler.

2. Open **Internet Explorer** > **Options** > **Internet Options** > **Connections** > **LAN Settings**.

3. Click the check box by **Use a proxy server for your LAN**.

 ![Set proxy address][1]

4. Type the address and port number for the upstream proxy.

5. Restart Fiddler.

You should now see the upstream proxy listed in the Fiddler **About** dialog.
