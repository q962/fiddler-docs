Capture Traffic from iOS Device
===============================

Configure Fiddler
-----------------

1. Open Fiddler and stop capturing.

2. Open **_Tools > Options > HTTPS_** and disable **_Capturing HTTPS Connects_**.

3. Close Fiddler and install BouncyCastle (CertMaker.dll) from [here](https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftelerik-fiddler.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffiddler%2Faddons%2Ffiddlercertmaker.exe%3A6S55_jduFvAwH1hSJcNA8KXcBzQ&cuid=3627150). â€“ this will add CertMaker.dll in your Fiddler installation, and it will change the way certificates are generated. With this option, Fiddler will use only one root certificate and will not generate intermediate certificates for each option.

4. After installation is complete, open Fiddler, open **_Tools > Options > HTTPS_** menu use **_Actions > Reset all certificates_** option. This will remove all previously used certificates and will trust the new one.

5. After agreeing with all system dialogs, enable Capturing (**_Tools > Options > HTTPS_** and check **_Capturing HTTPS Connects_**) and decryption of HTTPS traffic ((**_Tools > Options > HTTPS_** and check **_Decrypt HTTPS traffic_**)).

6. Open **_Tools > Options > Connections_**.

7. Click the checkbox for **_Allow remote computers to connect_**.

8. Restart Fiddler.

9. Ensure your firewall allows incoming connections to the Fiddler process and that it's not blocking all incoming connections, including those in the list of allowed apps.

10. Hover over the **Online indicator** at the Fiddler toolbar's far-right to display the IP addresses assigned to Fiddler's machine. Use this address on your iOS device (see the 5th step in the iOS device setup steps below).

11. Verify client iOS device can reach Fiddler by navigating in the browser to **http://FiddlerMachineIP:8888**. This address should return the **Fiddler Echo Service** page.

12. For iPhone: Disable the 3g/4g connection.


Set the iOS Device Proxy
------------------------

1. On the iOS device open **_Settings > General > Profiles_** and remove all **DO_NOT_TRUST_FiddlerRoot** profiles. You must remove them (not disabling them).

2. Go to **_Settings > WiFi_** on your iOS device.

3. Find your current network and click the **i** icon.

4. Scroll to the bottom and choose **Manual** in the **_Configure Proxy_** option.

5. Type your Fiddler machine IP address in the **Server** field.

6. Type the Fiddler Everywhere listening port (8888 by default) in the **Port** field and finally tap on **Save**.

    >tip With the current setup, you should be able to capture non-secure HTTP traffic. However, if you try to open any **HTTPS** website, you'll get the _This site's security certificate is not trusted!_ error. To fix this, proceed with the steps that follow below.

7. Open a browser on the iOS device and type the Fiddler echo service address: **http://ipv4.fiddler:8888**

8. Click on the Fiddler root certificate link to download it.

0. On your iOS device, open **_General_** and install the certificate via the **_Profile Downloaded_**. Note that this option will appear after the certificate is downloaded.

10. (iOS 10.3+) Go to **_General > About > Certificate Trust Settings_** and **enable full trust** for the **DO_NOT_TRUST_FiddlerRoot** certificate. Note that you will see the **DO_NOT_TRUST_FiddlerRoot** certificate only after completing the previous step. 


Uninstall FiddlerRoot Certificate
---------------------------------

If you decide to uninstall the root certificate:

1. Tap the **Settings** app.

2. Tap **General**.

3. Scroll to **Profiles**.

4. Tap the **DO_NOT_TRUST_FiddlerRoot*** profile.

5. Tap **Remove**.
