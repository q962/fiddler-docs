View Cookie Information
=======================

1. Install the [Privacy Scanner Fiddler add-on][1].

 Fiddler will gain a new top-level menu named **Privacy**.

 ![Privacy menu][2]

2. Ensure **Privacy > Enabled** is checked.

 The add-on will add a **Privacy Info** column to the session list and will flag HTTP/HTTPS responses which set cookies. 

Evaluation of any P3P statements that come along with those cookies will change the session's background color:

 ![Privacy Info Column][3]

+ **Green** sessions send a satisfactory P3P policy.
+ **Yellow** sessions set a cookie without a P3P policy.
+ **Orange** sessions send a P3P policy that [does not permit use of the cookie in a 3rd party context][4].
+ **Red** sessions send invalid P3P policies.
