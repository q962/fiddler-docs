Controlling Fiddler with Test Automation
========================================

ExecAction.exe is a command line executable which is suitable for calling from batch files or unit tests.  It passes its command line into FiddlerScript's **OnExecAction** function for processing, just like Fiddler's [QuickExec box][1].  The ExecAction commands can be handled by FiddlerScript or FiddlerExtensions.

ExecAction.exe is installed into the Fiddler directory inside your Program Files folder.

**Usage:**
               ExecAction SCRIPTPARAMETER
               ExecAction "PARAM1 PARAM2"

ExecAction sets **%ERRORLEVEL%** to

+ 0 if successful
+ 1 if an incorrect (!= 1) number of arguments used
+ 2 if the Fiddler window could not be found.
